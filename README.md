# XUL-to-HTML
XUL to HTML converter


Bring out your XUL... Bring out your XUL...

And convert your XUL to HTML. Since we are keen on recycling, you can recylce your XUl to HTML and give that XUL GUI another shot at life.
The converter has a short list of most used XUL tags that will be converted to DIV's, and use the XUL objectname as either a class or id.

Currently there is no replacement for styling the converted markup. We need CSS emulation of the XUL elements and JavaScript emulation for the attributes.
