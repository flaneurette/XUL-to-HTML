# XUL-to-HTML
XUL to HTML converter


Bring our your XUL! Bring out your XUL...

And convert your XUL to HTML. Since we are keen on recycling, you can recylce your XUl to HTML and give that XUL GUI another shot at life.
The converter has a short list of most used XUL tags that will be converted to DIV's, and use the XUL objectname as either a class or id.

Some background noise:
----------------------

Mozilla, that mischievous animal who wants to stay hip, dropped support for XUL leaving it's developers with the problem of having to convert their extensions to some fancy new framework (that XUL once was). Thousands of hours went into programming extensions, and Mozilla just takes all that "free time" that developers have put into their extenstions for granted and drops it into the trash. So much for the respecting standards...
